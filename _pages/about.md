## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher specializing in urban knowledge graphs at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I completed my PhD in Transportation from the South China University of Technology in 2024 .  My research interests include driver behavior detection analysis, environmental perception, natural language processing (NLP), and integrating large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs.
